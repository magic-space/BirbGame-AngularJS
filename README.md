# The Birbgame

To run the application in stand-alone mode, please use the `dist` folder's `index.html`. Compiling the TypeScript using Angular 2 should be possible with the source code present in `src`. Unfortunately, the `node_modules` foler was too large to be included in a GitHub repository. Please let me know if you need the contents of that folder.

## How to play ##

You will begin with a single egg, which will hatch as time passes. This Peep is your go-to for collecting natural resources, including food, nesting materials, ore, and the skills to survive in this cruel world. Each resource comes with multiple tasks that can be done, growing in complexity.

Clicking on a resource or task's icon will allow it to be upgraded, either increasing that resource capacity, or increasing the yield of that task.

However, your Peeps will need to be fed, and regular maintainence on housing, storage facilities, and tools will need to be performed. As such, you will find your food, nest, and ore supplies dwindling over time, requiring constant production to stay afloat! Make sure to balance your assignments accordingly. 

There currently is no "win" condition, just keep growing your peep-ulation and amass resources.

If you'd like to start over, click the gear in the top right corner to wipe your save file.
